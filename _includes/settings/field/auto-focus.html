    <h3 id="field-auto-focus">autoFocus: Boolean</h3>

    <p>Indicate the field will be focused on automatically if it is not valid. It is <code>true</code>, by default.</p>
    <p>In some case, you don't want the invalid field to be focused automatically. For example, focusing on a field using a date picker might show up the picker, which seems to be annoyed.</p>
