<p>FormValidation v0.8.0 supports both Foundation 5 and 6. Since Foundation v6 is the latest stable version, you need to
perform the following changes if you still want to use Foundation 5:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Including the correct files</h3>

<p>This section is already mentioned in the <a href="/getting-started/#including-library">Including library</a> section:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<!-- Foundation v5 CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/vendor/foundation/css/normalize.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/vendor/foundation/css/foundation.min.css">

<!-- FormValidation CSS file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/vendor/formvalidation/dist/css/formValidation.min.css">

<!-- jQuery v1.9.1 or higher -->
<script src="/vendor/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script>

<!-- Foundation JS file -->
<script src="/vendor/foundation/js/vendor/modernizr.js"></script>
<script src="/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.js"></script>
<script src="/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.tooltip.js"></script>

<!-- FormValidation plugin and the class supports validating Foundation form -->
<script src="/vendor/formvalidation/dist/js/formValidation.min.js"></script>

<!-- The file supporting Foundation v5 is `foundation5.min.js` -->
<script src="/vendor/formvalidation/dist/js/framework/foundation5.min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="doc-alert doc-alert-warning">
    <p>Don't confuse foundation(.min).js file provided by the Foundation framework with
        foundation5(.min).js provided by FormValidation which is placed inside the formvalidation/dist/js/framework directory.</p>
    <p>They are two different files and both of them need to be included as mentioned above.</p>
</div>

<h3>Step 2: Setting the framework option</h3>

<p>You need to set the <a href="/settings/#form-framework">framework</a> option as <code>foundation5</code>:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$(yourForm).formValidation({
    framework: 'foundation5',
    ...
});
{% endhighlight %}
